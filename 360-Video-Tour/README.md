# 360 Video Tour


**The bones of a larger idea**


The goal of this project was to build a 360 Video Tour of the Holberton School San Francisco campus.
I chose the SteamVR plugin to develop this application, due to it being compatible with a wide array of hardware.
As of now, no navigation between the different videos is possible, due to the compatibility limitations
of SteamVR and the Unity UI elements. In the future, I intend to refactor this project to have one room for
viewing all 360 degree videos, and a UI panel attached to the player's wrist to select videos inside the project,
from their hard drive, or by URL. These videos will be projected to the skybox to ensure the highest possible quality
and seamless videos.
